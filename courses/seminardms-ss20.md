# Seminar Distributed MM Systems (2017)
In this seminar on distributed multimedia systems your task is to pick a specific topic from this field and study,
assess, summarize and discuss related literature in your own paper. All in all your seminar thesis should give an
overview on the state of the art for unaware readers. Note at that point that your seminar paper is assessed as a
scientific paper.

# Your paper
Your task is to find work related to the the topic you select, read and assess it, put it into context and describe 
relations, benefit etc. This is also called a comparative study. 

Your paper is a scientific article. It has to match scientific quality in terms of citations, argumentation, facts, readability, and so on.
Your submission has to follow the _ACM SIG Proceedings Style_. You can find it on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt) or on the [authors' page](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). You are strongly encouraged to use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/) and check your text using [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/).

Your paper should have 5000 words. That's around 6 pages in the given ACM style.

# Presentations
Each of the participants has to give three presentations.

## Start presentation
Goal of the start presentation is that you show that you have grasped the topic and know where to start. Describe your topic, give examples, and give us an idea on what you want to do when. If you have done research on papers, applications, tools, etc. already, give us preliminary results.  

## Intermediate presentation
Goal of this presentation is to show the topic to your colleagues and to show your current status of the seminar paper. At this point you should have read and understood your starting papers and have gotten a feeling for the topic as a whole. You don't need to have significant text, but I expect you to have found and investigates up to 5 related papers. The presentation is scheduled to last 240 seconds in [PechaKucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha)-like style, so each of your 12 slides is up on the wall for 20 seconds. Make sure you have got your slide setup prepared for that.

## Final presentation
The final presentation should take 15 minutes (no more and no less) and should summarize your work done in the paper.
