# Introduction to Computer Graphics

This course aims to give a basic understanding of computer graphics and its role in computer games.
Topics will be a math primer, 2D and 3D graphics, shading, and hands on with practical tools.
Grading is based on (i) mandatory assignments, (ii) a final project, and (iii) a final report

## Schedule

All courses start s.t. in [Klagenfurt local time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/austria/klagenfurt) if not otherwise noted. Slides are available online (see below). Due to the situation around CoViD-19 we start the summer term 2022 with online lectures and see where it leads us. After the online courses, lecture recordings are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkb7TymgoWW4ADg6BakZ4va4utZbP-3iy) and for [download](https://www2.itec.aau.at/owncloud/index.php/s/H9glFm1LXXXxRZn). Live lectures are taking place on the Twitch Channel [https://www.twitch.tv/dermotte_](https://www.twitch.tv/dermotte_).

After the course you can find me in the _Lectures Q&A_ audio channel in the [GSE Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YnX6AKG).

## Exercises (Mandatory Assignments)

Please upload the exercises (just the .js or the .pde file and eventual texture or model files) to Moodle until the end of the announced day.

## Final Project
Please prepare your final project until **June 23, 2022**. Goal of the final project is to apply what you learned in the lecture in a practical way. Basic idea is to model a scene in Blender and render it. However, if this does not challenge you enough, then pick a topic and a challenge in the field of computer graphics, and get creative with a tool of your choice. This can for instance be a 3D game, a demo in a game engine, or a extensive dive into shader programming.

For the presentation on June 23, 2022 make sure you can

1. show your result,
2. outline your work (contribution), and
3. discuss the lessons learned and obstacles encountered.

Please also make sure to deliver the following items in a ZIP file via upload on Moodle until **June 23, 2022**

1. Your work as source code or a link to Github, Bitbucket, etc.
2. Your result as rendering (images, movie) or executable (eg. Windows or web)
3. Your slides from the presentation
4. A PDF work report with a (i) cover page including your name and student number, (ii) a main text body of around 800 words (2 pages) detailing what you did, how you did it, and what you learned.

## How to get a positive grade?
Please make sure to fulfil the requirements to the letter. As the current situation requires to do everything online, I cannot build upon my communication with you in the classroom. If you cannot meet the requirements for a positive grade, please let me know before the deadlines, e.g. tell me that you are not able to submit an exercise before it is due.

1. Hand in all assignments in time
2. Do and present the final project
3. Submit your project with a report

Each of the above makes up a third of your grade, but you have to submit them all to get a positive grade.
