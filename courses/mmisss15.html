<h1>Multimedia Information Systems</h1>
<p>
    The course multimedia information aims to give an overview on multimedia information retrieval, multimedia databases
    and multimedia metadata. The course also took place in summer semesters in previous years. You can find a page and
    all the slides of the former courses, like <a href="?id=courses/mmisss14">here</a>.

    A large part of the course is based on the book "Visual Information Retrieval with Java and LIRE" by M. Lux and O.
    Marques (see <a href="http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00468ED1V01Y201301ICR025">here</a>)
