# Game Engineering

The goal of this course is to introduce students to computer game engineering. This is
not necessarily a technical issue especially as game engineering involves mostly non-technical work like
creative audio, 3D and visual design, product management and planning, story boarding &amp; writing, and
testing. 

After this course students should be able to understand the concepts and roles within a game project with the 
knowledge how a game project can be set up and run, as well as detailed knowledge on particular processes within the 
project.
