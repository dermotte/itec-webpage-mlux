# Advanced Topics in Game Engineering

Throughout the semester a game is produced and students take over a role in a team. The process includes planning, design, development, testing, marketing and roll-out. It will be a combination of workshops, stand-up meetings, self-organized development sessions, student presentations and lectures. There will be guest lectures, which can be online (on Twitch.tv), and an optional excursion to two video game developer studios in Graz.
