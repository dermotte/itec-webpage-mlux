<h1>Computer Games</h1>
<p>
    The goal of this course is to introduce students to computer game production. This is not necessarily a technical
    issue especially as game production involves mostly non-technical work like creative audio, 3D and visual design,
    product management and planning, story boarding &amp; writing, and testing.

    The course has already taken place in previous years, so you might take a look at the <a
        href="?id=courses/gamesss14">old web page</a>.
    The lecture is given in German, but slides and homepage are written in English. For assignments you can choose
    between German and English language.
