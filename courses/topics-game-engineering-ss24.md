# Advanced Topics in Game Engineering

Throughout the semester a game is produced and students take over a role in a team. The process includes planning,
design, development, testing, marketing and roll-out. It will be a combination of workshops, stand-up meetings,
self-organized development sessions, student presentations and lectures. There will be guest lectures, which can be
online (on Twitch.tv). The ultimate goal of the lecture is to prepare a submission to the [PGDA Young Talent Award](https://pgda.at/2023/11/19/pgda-announces-talent-award-2024/).

## Deliverables

This course is not only about the final outcome, i.e. the game, but about reflecting work in a team with the goal to create a game. The presentations and deliverables document both, the progress and the lessons learned and are the basis for your grade.

Within the process of developing a game, several documents need to be written. For each role, the deliverable is different. However, each of them includes a reflection on what did you learn and what would do differently next time.

| Role                 | Document                                 | Scope                                                         |
|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Game Designer        | Game Design Document                     | Game mechanics, level design, etc.                            |
| Software Developer   | Software Design Document                 | Technical documentation, requirements, etc.                   |
| Visual Artist        | Concept Art, Art Design                  | Look of the game, how did that develop?                 | 
| Music / SFX Artist   | Sound & Music Design                     | Game audio, how did that develop?                             | 
| Writer               | Narrative Design                         | Story, dialogues, characters, etc.                            |
| Playtesting Engineer | Playtesting Documentation                | Plan, design, and results of playtests                        | 
| Producer             | Project plan and implementation thereof  | Meeting notes, documentation, communication, ...              |
| PR / Community Mgmt. | Plan and documentation on implementation | What and when, documentation of effects (Twitch, TikTok, ...) |


Each student needs to submit an **individual final report** of **4000 words** including 

1. Documentation assigned to the role (3000 words)
2. Reflection of the work done (1000 words)
   1. What went well? - Victories, things that you are proud of. Describe your key moments. Provide details. Examine your experience. Also, think about your group. Especially when it comes to the communication.
   1. What went wrong? - Mistakes, disasters, problems. What situation / event / part of the circumstances do you remember the most? What happened? Think of the process of the game creation, and technical issues, but also think about the interpersonal behavior within your group.
   1. Conclusion and Take Home Messages - Analyze your work in the team. What lessons did you learn (3 examples)? e.g. Whether it's tool usage or something within the creation process or even group dynamics, like working with new people over distance. What’s the impact of that experience on you? Be self-aware. What would you do differently next time?

Please note paper format, code of conduct, and plagiarism policies apply as detailed below.

## How to get a positive grade?

Please make sure to fulfil the requirements to the letter. If you cannot meet the requirements for a positive grade,
please let me know before the deadlines, e.g., tell me that you are not able to submit an exercise a few days before it
is due.

1. Visit all classes
2. Do and present the final project
3. Submit the deliverables

You have to meet all four requirements to get a positive grade. The grade itself is derived from your presentations and
your final report.

Please note paper format, code of conduct, and plagiarism policies apply as detailed below.

### Paper Format

- Orderly fulfillment of formal requirements:
    * A paper follows the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/) - use
      the [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/the-chicago-citation-style-with-biblatex/pdqqrmwtdqpc)
      if you want a strict implementation.
    * A paper is coherently formatted
    * A paper has a bibliography referencing all employed sources, including but not limited to online videos, web
      pages, and code repositories
- Adequate reliance on research literature:
    * Selection of citations
    * Provision of a well-formatted bibliography
- Reliance on theoretical resources
- Self-made observations on the discussed primary resource
- Critical reflection on self-made observations

### Code of Conduct and Plagiarism Policies

The [University of California Berkely](https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/integrity/definition) offers the following
definition:

```md
Plagiarism is defined as use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for
example:

* Wholesale copying of passages from works of others into your homework, essay, term paper, or dissertation without
  acknowledgment.
* Use of the views, opinions, or insights of another without acknowledgment.
* Paraphrasing of another person’s characteristic or original phraseology, metaphor, or other literary device without
  acknowledgment.
```

For computer science classes this includes source code, video tutorials, and web pages used to create software for the
course. It is mandatory to check for license compatibility, like (i) can it be used, (ii) how to attribute, and (iii)
what license is implied by including this source. It is also mandatory to cite the sources in the report. Failing to do
that counts as plagiarism.

Note that the [Code of Conduct of the AAU](https://www.aau.at/en/research/research-profile/good-academic-practice/) and the GSE Code of Conduct apply. Students caught plagiarising or violation of the code of conduct will be removed from class immediately.
