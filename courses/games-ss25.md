# Interaktive Multimediasysteme B (Computer Games)

The goal of this course is to introduce students to computer game production. This is
not necessarily a technical issue especially as game production involves mostly non-technical work like
creative audio, 3D and visual design, product management and planning, story boarding &amp; writing, and
testing.
The course has already taken place in previous years, so you might take a look at the
[2024 web page](?id=courses/games-ss24.md). The lecture is given in German,
but slides and homepage are written in English. For assignments, you can choose between German and English language.

## Modalities
The course aims to teach in a practical as well as in a theoretical way. Throughout the lecture you will have (i) readings, (ii) practical assignments, (iii) a final exam and (iv) a final game project. The readings are specific to the lecture topic and will be referenced from the web page. Make sure you read (or watch or play) them. Questions might pop up in the final exam. The final grade is based on the (i) assignments, (ii) the final project and a (iii) final exam.
