# Non Entertainment Games

The goal of this course is to introduce students to games that are mainly created for purposes other than entertainment. This includes but is not limited to serious games, educational games, adware games, fitness games, and propaganda games.

A positive grade can be achieved by reaching at least Level 3 in the [Experience System](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bVMx1yMFUEj0xx668i2HjwBJt9RncX_cveRDOdVdxH8/edit?usp=sharing) for the class. **Mandatory tasks** are
