# Game Engineering

The goal of this course is to introduce students to computer game engineering. This is
not necessarily a technical issue, especially as game engineering involves mostly non-technical work like
creative audio, 3D and visual design, product management and planning, story boarding &amp; writing, and
testing.

After this course, students should be able to understand the concepts and roles within a game project with the
knowledge of how a game project can be set up and run, as well as detailed knowledge on particular processes within the
project.

The practical course associated with the lecture is taking place as a game jam. Find more information on the [game jam website](http://itec.aau.at/gamejam/) soon.

## Online, but How?

Due to the international nature of the Game Studies and Engineering program, we will start the semester with a hybrid lecture. Please find the virtual classroom in [Moodle](https://moodle.aau.at/course/view.php?id=35650). Guest access in Moodle is enabled for the beginning of the semester. There, we will broadcast from the lecture room. Note that we only support streaming of audio and the slides right now.

## Modalities

This course is a _Vorlesung_, meaning that the grade is awarded after a final examination. The open book exam will take 60 minutes of your time and will focus on the topics discussed in the course. A [list of possible exam questions is available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z3XhU1tYw1JmpIryDF9UBoEK8fPYe5nruExHBayOzMU/edit?usp=sharing).
