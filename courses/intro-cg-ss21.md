# Introduction to Computer Graphics

This course aims to give a basic understanding of computer graphics and its role in computer games.
Topics will be a math primer, 2D and 3D graphics, shading, and hands on with practical tools.
Grading is based on (i) mandatory assignments, (ii) a final project, and (iii) a final exam

## Schedule

All courses start s.t. in [Klagenfurt local time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/austria/klagenfurt) if not otherwise noted. Slides are available online (see below). Due to the situation around CoViD-19 all lectures take place online. After the online courses, lecture recordings are available.

## Final Project
Please prepare your final project until **June 17, 2021**. Goal of the final project is to apply what you learned in the lecture in a practical way. Basic idea is to model a scene in Blender and render it. However, if you this does not challenge you enough, then pick a topic and a challenge in the field of computer graphics and get creative. This can for instance be a 3D game, a demo in a game engine, or a extensive dive into shader programming.

For the presentation on June 17, 2021 make sure you can

1. show your result,
2. outline your work (contribution), and
3. discuss the lessons learned and obstacles encountered.

## How to get a positive grade?
Please make sure to fulfil the requirements to the letter. As the current situation requires to do everything online, I cannot build upon my communication with you in the classroom. If you cannot meet the requirements for a positive grade, please let me know before the deadlines, e.g. tell me that you are not able to submit an exercise before it is due.

1. Hand in all assignments in time
2. Do and present the final project
3. Take the exam

Each of the above makes up a third of your grade, but you have to submit them all to get a positive grade.
