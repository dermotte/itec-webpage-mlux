# Advanced Topics in Computer Graphics

This course will dive into specific topics in the broad area of computer graphics. While details have not yet been decided, the direction will be procedurally generated content (PCG) and AR/VR. The course will require a significant amount of practical work, so programming knowledge is required. We will implement standard algorithms for PCG in computer games and put them to use in a VR environment. The web page will be updated continuously. Grading is based on (i) mandatory assignments, (ii) a final project, and (iii) a final exam.

All courses start s.t. in [Klagenfurt local time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/austria/klagenfurt) if not otherwise noted. Slides are available online (see below). Due to the situation around CoViD-19 we start the summer term 2022 with online lectures and see where it leads us. After the online courses, lecture recordings are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and for [download](https://www2.itec.aau.at/owncloud/index.php/s/kzAyrtJ8MGTfIGA). Live lectures are taking place on the Twitch Channel [https://www.twitch.tv/dermotte_](https://www.twitch.tv/dermotte_).
