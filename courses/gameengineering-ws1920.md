# Game Engineering

The goal of this course is to introduce students to computer game engineering. This is
not necessarily a technical issue especially as game engineering involves mostly non-technical work like
creative audio, 3D and visual design, product management and planning, story boarding &amp; writing, and
testing. 

After this course students should be able to understand the concepts and roles within a game project with the 
knowledge how a game project can be set up and run, as well as detailed knowledge on particular processes within the 
project.

The practical course associated with the lecture is taking place as a game jam. Find more information on that on the [game jam website](http://itec.aau.at/gamejam/).

## Modalities 

This course is a _Vorlesung_, meaning that the grade is awarded after a final examination. The exam will be in written 
form, take 50 minutes of your time and will focus on the topics discussed in the course. A [list of possible exam questions is available here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PF0CIe6nT5-dmRtOhRKg5nrlPFZfr6ikoH1xQHE22iU).
