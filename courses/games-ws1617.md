# Introduction to Computer Game Production 

The goal of this course is to introduce students to computer game production. This is
not only a technical issue, especially as game production involves non-technical work like
creative audio, 3D and visual design, product management and planning, story boarding &amp; writing, and
testing.

The course has already taken place in previous years at Klagenfurt University, so you might take a look at the
[2015 web page](?id=courses/gamesss15) or the [2014 web page](?id=courses/gamesss14).
