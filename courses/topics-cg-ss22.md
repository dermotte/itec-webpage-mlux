# Advanced Topics in Computer Graphics

This course will dive into specific topics in the broad area of computer graphics. While details have not yet been decided, the direction will be procedurally generated content (PCG) and AR/VR. The course will require a significant amount of practical work, so programming knowledge is required. We will implement common algorithms for PCG in computer games and put them to use in a VR environment.
