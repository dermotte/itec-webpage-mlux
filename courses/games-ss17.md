# Interaktive Multimediasysteme B (Computer Games) 

The goal of this course is to introduce students to computer game production. This is
not necessarily a technical issue especially as game production involves mostly non-technical work like
creative audio, 3D and visual design, product management and planning, story boarding &amp; writing, and
testing.
The course has already taken place in previous years, so you might take a look at the
[2016 web page](?id=courses/games-ss16.md). The lecture is given in German, 
but slides and homepage are written in English. For assignments you can choose between German and English language.

#### Modalities
The course aims to teach in a practical as well as in a theoretical way. Throughout the
lecture you will have (i) readings, (ii) practical assignments, and (iii) a final game project. The readings
are specific to the lecture topic and will be referenced from the web page. Make sure you read (or watch)
them. Questions might pop up in the final multiple choice test. The final grade is based on the (i)
assignments as well as the final project and a (ii) final multiple choice test.

* Readings - For the course it's mandatory to read (or view in case of videos) the readings. They will be announced throughout the course in the schedule table.
* Practical assignments - This year will feature two practical assignments prior to the final project. The tutorial will focus on bringing you up to speed to implement these projects. For more details see below.    
* Final project - Create a game in a group, more information see below.

#### Tutorial
Associated with the course is the [Tutorium zu Interaktive Multimedia-Anwendungen B (Computer Games)](https://campus.aau.at/studium/course/87507) held by Fabian Schober. While the main course as is is not necessarily about the __programming__ aspect of games, the tutorial definitely is. Fabian Schober has experience on several game development platforms including Unity, libGDX, Phaser and Unreal and is willing to share his experience. In the tutorial he will focus on bringing you up to speed for the practical assignments. Please make sure you are enrolled.
