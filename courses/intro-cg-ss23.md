# Introduction to Computer Graphics

This course aims to give a basic understanding of computer graphics and its role in computer games.
Topics will be a math primer, 2D and 3D graphics, shading, and hands on with practical tools.
Grading is based on (i) mandatory assignments, (ii) a final project, and (iii) a final report

## Final Project
Please prepare your final project until **June 29, 2023**. Goal of the final project is to apply what you learned in the lecture in a practical way. Basic idea is to model a scene in Blender and render it. However, if this does not challenge you enough, then pick a topic and a challenge in the field of computer graphics, and get creative with a tool of your choice. This can for instance be a 3D game, a demo in a game engine, or a extensive dive into shader programming.

For the presentation (max duration 3 minutes) on June 29, 2023 make sure you can

1. show your result,
2. outline your work (contribution), and
3. discuss the lessons learned and obstacles encountered.

Please also make sure to deliver the following items in a ZIP file via upload on Moodle until **June 29, 2023**

1. Your work as source code or a link to Github, Bitbucket, etc.
2. Your result as rendering (images, movie) or executable (eg. Windows or web)
3. Your slides from the presentation
4. A PDF work report with a (i) cover page including your name and student number, (ii) a main text body of around 800 words (2 pages) detailing what you did, how you did it, and what you learned.

## How to get a positive grade?
Please make sure to fulfil the requirements to the letter. As the current situation requires to do everything online, I cannot build upon my communication with you in the classroom. If you cannot meet the requirements for a positive grade, please let me know before the deadlines, e.g. tell me that you are not able to submit an exercise before it is due.

1. Hand in all assignments in time
2. Do and present the final project
3. Submit your project with a report

Each of the above makes up a third of your grade, but you have to submit them all to get a positive grade.

Please note term paper format, code of conduct, and plagiarism policies apply as detailed below.

### Paper Format
- Orderly fulfillment of formal requirements:
    * A paper follows the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/) - use the [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/the-chicago-citation-style-with-biblatex/pdqqrmwtdqpc) if you want a strict implementation.
    * A paper is coherently formatted
    * A paper has a bibliography referencing all employed sources, including but not limited to online videos, web pages, and code repositories
- Adequate reliance on research literature:
    * Selection of citations
    * Provision of a well-formatted bibliography
-	Reliance on theoretical resources
-	Self-made observations on the discussed primary resource
-	Critical reflection on self-made observations


### Code of Conduct and Plagiarism Policies

The [University of California Berkely](https://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct/integrity/definition) offers the following definition:

```md
Plagiarism is defined as use of intellectual material produced by another person without acknowledging its source, for example:
* Wholesale copying of passages from works of others into your homework, essay, term paper, or dissertation without acknowledgment.
* Use of the views, opinions, or insights of another without acknowledgment.
* Paraphrasing of another person’s characteristic or original phraseology, metaphor, or other literary device without acknowledgment.
```

For computer science classes this includes source code, video tutorials, and web pages used to create software for the course. It is mandatory to check for license compatibility, like (i) can it be used, (ii) how to attribute, and (iii) what license is implied by including this source. It is also mandatory to cite the sources in the report. Failing to do that counts as plagiarism.

Note that the [Code of Conduct of the AAU](https://www.aau.at/en/research/research-profile/good-academic-practice/) applies. Students caught plagiarising or violation of the code of conduct will be removed from class immediately.
