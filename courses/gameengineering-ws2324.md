# Game Engineering

The goal of this course is to introduce students to computer game engineering. Game engineering is not necessarily a technical issue, especially as game engineering involves mostly non-technical work like creative audio, 3D and visual design, product management and planning, storyboarding & writing, and testing.

After this course, students should be able to understand the concepts and roles within a game project with the understanding of how a game project can be set up and run, and detailed knowledge of particular processes within the project.

The practical course associated with the lecture is taking place as a game jam on Dec 15-17, 2023. Find more information on the [game jam website](http://itec.aau.at/gamejam/) later in the semester. 

## Online Lectures

Due to the international nature of the Game Studies and Engineering program and the limited availability of lecture rooms, we'll hold roughly 50% of the lecture online on Twitch.tv. Please join the classes marked online at [https://twitch.tv/dermotte_](https://twitch.tv/dermotte_)

## Modalities

This course is a _Vorlesung_, meaning that the grade is awarded after a final examination. The open book exam will take 60 minutes of your time and will focus on the topics discussed in the course. A [list of possible exam questions is available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mvdgXJl7ckqvTvY6unqEGGiHF7bwgz4frzoh4uxip9o/edit?usp=sharing).
