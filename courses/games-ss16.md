# Interaktive Multimedia-Anwendungen B (Computer Games)

The goal of this course is to introduce students to computer game production. This is
not necessarily a technical issue especially as game production involves mostly non-technical work like
creative audio, 3D and visual design, product management and planning, story boarding &amp; writing, and
testing.
The course has already taken place in previous years, so you might take a look at the
[2015 web page](?id=courses/gamesss15) or the [2014 web page](?id=courses/gamesss14). The lecture is given in German, 
but slides and homepage are written in English. For assignments you can choose between German and English language.

# Modalities
The course aims to teach in a practical as well as in a theoretical way. Throughout the
lecture you will have (i) readings, (ii) practical assignments, and (iii) a final game project. The readings
are specific to the lecture topic and will be referenced from the web page. Make sure you read (or watch)
them. Questions might pop up in the final multiple choice test. The final grade is based on the (i)
assignments as well as the final project and a (ii) final multiple choice test.

## Readings
For the course it's mandatory to read (or view in case of videos) the readings. They will be announced throughout the 
course.

## Practical assignments
This year will feature two practical assignments prior to the final project. The tutorial will focus on bringing you up 
to speed to implement these projects. While the actual projects have to be announced yet, we consider at the time the 
first being a Pong-like game, and the second a simple platformer.   

## Final project
For the final project you have to create a game including 

1. a game concept document, 
2. the actual game implementation ready to test,
3. a post mortem discussing the pitfalls, lessons learned and process of making the game, and
4. a final presentation.

You are free to choose the platform for making the game. Games should be made in groups of three to four people.  

Like last year, you can do your final project as part of the [3rd Klagenfurt Game Jam](http://itec.aau.at/gamejam/). 
This is the recommended way and a great opportunity to learn __a lot__ about actually making games and most of the work 
is done within one single weekend. 

# Tutorial
Associated with the course is the [Tutorium zu Interaktive Multimedia-Anwendungen B (Computer Games)](https://campus.aau.at/studien/lvkarte.jsp?sprache_nr=35&rlvkey=86382) 
held by Fabian Schober. While the main course as is is not necessarily about the __programming__ aspect of games, the 
tutorial definitely is. Fabian Schober has experience on several game development platforms including Unity, libGDX, Phaser 
and Unreal and is willing to share his experience. In the tutorial he will focus on bringing you up to speed for the 
practical assignments. Please make sure you are enrolled.
